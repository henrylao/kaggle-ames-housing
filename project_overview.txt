Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the 
height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this 
playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations 
than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of 
residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict 
the final price of each home.

Practice Skills:

* Creative feature engineering 
* Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
